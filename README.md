# Project Overview
  Development of Google Flood Map (GFM) Android application for early warning of flood.
# Project Description

This project aims to develop an android application, which can be used for early warning of flood for a given area. To start with, the proposed area in this project is Guwahati city, a fast developing urban city in North East India. This application will be similar to the google traffic map, which gives a real time status of traffic congestion in a given area. The flood warning app currently developed will not be a real time warning system. To begin with, the application will give an early warning of flood scenarios in different parts of the city based on rainfall forecast. This necessitates the hydrological modelling of the given area for determining flood depth for a given rainfall intensity. The computed flood depth map can be integrated with android based flood warning in smart phone.

The project will employ Android Studio IDE along with ArcGIS Runtime SDK. The project aims to display flood inundation data and userâ€™s location on the Google map. The App will get the current position through GPS or network provider from the user mobile phone. The App would collect 7 day Rainfall Forecast from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) based on which the flood warning will be issued. There will be a server where in the flood modelling will be done based on the rainfall forecast. The output from the flood modelling, i.e., the flood inundation map will be displayed in different colour scheme to show the extend of flooding in a given area.With network of rain gauges deployed in a given area, this application can be extended to near real time flood forecasting. This will be future work of the proposed project.


## Who will benefit from this project?

  Though almost all districts in Assam are a flood-prone area,People in areas close to Bramhaputra river and some other low lying areas will benifit a lot by taking precautions and prepare themselves from a flood.
